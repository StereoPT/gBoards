## Development Server

In order for you to use this Project, you need to have a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) Account, and a Database Created.

After that, create a `config.json` inside the **backend** folder with the following data:

`{"mongo_url": "url to your database", "database": "database name"}`

With that done, you are good to run the project.
